Used the NF(Number of Fields) variable to pickup the last column containing the
name of the shell. Used filtering to select only the lines beginning with /usr
## Steps to run:
1. This script needs no input, as our task is well defined to print all the 
   shells that belong to '/usr' and we need only the '/etc/shells' file.
   
2. The script run on a machine prints only the shell name, each on a new line.
